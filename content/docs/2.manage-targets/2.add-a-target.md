## What is a Target?

A target is the URL of a web application or website that you wish to scan and manage as a unit. This is the starting point for initiating scans and performing other actions within the application. Here are a few examples of what a target might look like:

* <p>https://app.example.com</p>
* <p> https://example.com/app1</p>
* <p>http://example.com</p>

Learn more about targets from [Targets](../getting-started/concepts.md#targets "mention")
